"""
The Hasher class is build to generate a number of hashes of a sample. 
Currently, it can calculate:
    [*] MD5
    [*] SHA-1
    [*] PE hash
    [*] Fuzzy hash

The script can be run on itself and will return the listed hashes of a FILE. 
Usage example: python hasher.py putty.exe

Note that only PE files are supported with PE hash

TODO:
    [ ] Add more hash types
    [ ] Add exception handling
